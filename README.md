# Recipe app

> The Recipe app keeps track of all the users' recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It allows users to save ingredients, keep track of what they have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what they have and what is missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app allows users to make them public so anyone can access them.
